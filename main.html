They did this in search of the Triforce, the ultimate power capable of granting any wishes of its holder. This power, passed down by the Golden Goddesses, was guarded by The Goddess Hylia, the goddess of the land. The Goddess Hylia gathered the Triforce and the remaining survivors onto a piece of earth and sent it skyward beyond the clouds. This piece of land came to be known as Skyloft. With the humans safe, The Goddess Hylia joined the land dwellers and fought the evil forces in a war of unmatched scale and ferocity. The Goddess Hylia eventually sealed the evil forces away, restoring peace to the Surface. However, the humans remained in Skyloft, as The Goddess Hylia knew that the seal on the evil would not hold forever. The Goddess Hylia knew that she would be powerless to stop the forces for a second time, so she required the use of the Triforce to defeat them again. However, a goddess cannot use the Triforce, so The Goddess Hylia gave up her immortality and was reincarnated as a mortal Hylian. Skyward Sword's in-game story establishes itself as the first game in the known Zelda timeline, exploring the beginning of the battle between good and evil within the legend, and establishing its key players: Zelda, as the incarnation of the Goddess Hylia, Link, the hero chosen by the Goddesses, and Ganondorf, as the manifestation of the Demon King Demise's hatred." >

Inside the castle, they meet up with the gathered six Maidens, whose purpose is to protect Hyrule as well as the Four Sword Sanctuary.

Shadow Link, as he calls him, has spread chaos in Hyrule, scorching villages and throwing them into the dark world. Traveling across Hyrule they witness the chaos brought about by Vaati and Shadow Link, and in order to release the dark seals placed by Vaati, the four Links must collect force gems in order to properly power up the Four Swords and grant it the power to repel evil.">

In order to do this, Ganondorf would require not only the three Spiritual Stones of Hyrule, but also the mystical Ocarina of Time.

In her misery, the princess isolated herself as the rest of the kingdom wept for her fate. Fear began to rise among the populace of Hytopia, as people grew afraid of fashion in fear of being cursed as well. As only chosen heroes could enter the Drablands, her father, King Tuft, sent out a notification to kingdoms near and far asking for heroes to assemble, promising a great reward. A prophecy within the kingdom, however, tells of the Tri Force Heroes, who are described as having pointy ears, sideburns, and side-parted hair, who come together to form a Totem. The prophecy goes on to say that once the Tri Force Heroes have overcome all challenges, the kingdom of Hytopia will be blessed with everlasting peace and style. The king firmly believes in this legend, and believes only those who possess these Three Noble Attributes of Courage are the true Tri Force Heroes. But there is more than one person claiming to be that hero. While passing through the land on his travels, Link notices King Tuft's sign asking for heroes to assemble.

Worried, he visited the reigning Zelda's nursemaid, Impa, who was shocked by the mark and took Link to North Castle, where Link opened a door that only he could open, and found a sleeping woman. The woman was another Princess Zelda. Impa then told Link the legend of Zelda handed down in Hyrule:            
                    Long ago a great ruler of Hyrule maintained peace using the Triforce, but once he died the Prince took over but only inherited the Triforce in part. A magician told him that before dying, the king told the Prince's sister, Princess Zelda, something about the Triforce. The Prince and the magician inquired about this, but she would say nothing. Against the Prince's orders, the magician put Zelda into a sleep from which she was not supposed to awake. In his grief, the Prince placed Zelda in the room where Link and Impa now stood and ordered that all female children of the royal household were to be named Zelda.
                    In a scroll only he could read, Link read of the three types of Triforce: Power, Wisdom, and Courage. The Triforce will show its true power when the three are brought together. Power and Wisdom were left in the kingdom, but Courage was hidden away until such a time as someone with extremely noble character appears. It is hidden in the Great Palace in the Valley of Death on Hyrule's largest island. Link must defeat the guardians and place the crystals in all of the palaces, then defeat the final guardian to reclaim the Triforce of Courage, thereby wake Zelda from her slumber and restoring peace to Hyrule.">

Link, the Hero of Winds, alongside Tetra and her pirates, successfully found a new continent ruled over by the Spirits of Good; sealing away the Demon King Malladus with the use of the Spirit Tracks. They named this new continent after Hyrule; however, to distinguish between the old and the new Hyrule, this one is referred to as New Hyrule. Link, a young boy in training to become an engineer under Alfonzo, lives with Niko in Aboda Village. He travels to Hyrule Castle to receive his Engineer Certificate from Princess Zelda, but during the ceremony, the princess discreetly hands him a letter, requesting him to read it alone. The letter reveals a passage into the castle, and she asks him to meet her later that day. When he does, she asks him to help her sneak out of the castle so she can visit the Tower of Spirits and discover what's behind the missing Spirit Tracks. However, on the way there, the tracks disappear beneath them and they crash. Byrne and Chancellor Cole soon appeared, kidnapping Princess Zelda and separating Zelda's spirit from her physical body. Link finds her spirit wandering around Hyrule Castle later, but he's the only one who could see her. The pair must then recover Zelda's body and defeat the revived Malladus.">
